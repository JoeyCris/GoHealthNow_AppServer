<p>Thank you very much for trying and using GlucoGuide. We want to share
with you a few new and exciting developments in recent months.</p>

<p>First of all, new versions (both Android and iOS) of GlucoGuide have
been released in early September. Please update it soon.</p>

<p>In the new version, texts are larger with high contrast for easy
viewing. In-App Help and Tips have been added - click the i icon.</p>

<p>Also food recognition from photos works in Auto-Estimate of the Diet
input. Though it can only recognize popular North
American dishes, we are constantly improving and expanding. If we
cannot recognize your food, please use Search with keywords to get
accurate nutrition information.</p>

<p>Another great feature of GlucoGuide is its Online Logbook. Go to
 <a href="https://myaccount.glucoguide.com">https://myaccount.glucoguide.com</a>
from a computer or tablet for a complete overview of your data, charts
and trends. You can see a Demo Logbook there! You can print your logbook
to bring to your healthcare providers!</p>

<p>A GlucoGuide Tutorial is also provided <a href="http://glucoguide.com/Tutorial_GlucoGuide.pdf">here</a></p>

questions, to <a href="mailto:support@glucoguide.com?Subject=Feedback%20for%20GlucoGuide">support@glucoguide.com</a>. We are always improving!</p>
